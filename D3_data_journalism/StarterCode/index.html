          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Age, Income</h2>
          <p>Correlations have been found between demographic and health risk data
            in the 2014 US Census Bureau's ACS estimated data, located at <a href=
            "https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/searchresults.xhtml">
            https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/searchresults.xhtml</a>.
            This data set includes data about median age, median household
            income, poverty, obesity, smoking, and access to health care insurance
            by state.
            The online version of this article includes an interactive tool that
            compares the data among the 50 states and District of Columbia.</p>

          <p>States with higher median ages were generally more likely to have healthcare
            insurance.
            Vermont, the second oldest state at 42.8, has only 6.7% lacking healthcare,
            while Texas, the fourth youngest state at 34.3, has the highest rate of
            people without healthcare at 24.9%.
            There is also a correlation between age and smoking, with older states
            having a higher percentage of smokers, although Utah, which has both the
            youngest median age at 30.5 and the lowest percentage of smokers at 9.7,
            may be skewing the results.
            Somewhat surprisingly, there is no clear correlation between age and
            obesity in the state data.</p>

          <p>In addition, people in states with higher median incomes and lower poverty
            were healthier than those in poorer states.  There is a correlation
            between higher poverty rates and higher rates of obesity, smoking, and
            lacking healthcare.
            For example, Mississippi has the highest poverty rate in the nation at
            21.5% and the third highest obesity rate at 35.5%.
            Conversely, states with a higher median income have
            lower rates.</p>

            <p>
              The states with the highest median age and household income
              and lowest poverty rates generally have better access to healthcare, so 
              it appears that those who are most able to afford it are more likely
              to have it, while those who need it the most are less likely.
